# Accepted differences: v11.1 port vs golden baseline

Every difference the acceptance runs surfaced between the ported model
(QEMU 11.1, branch `stix-emul-qemu-v11.1`) and the golden baseline
(repaired v5.2 model). Compared: qtest device suite (4/4 PASS, no
differences), boot smoke (PASS — no UART differences), `-d in_asm` head
(enumerated below).

## 1. `-d in_asm` head: bootloader preamble (accepted)

The v11.1 PROM bootloader stub (`write_bootloader`, reworked by upstream's
January 2024 LEON3 multiprocessor series) prepends four instructions before
the stores the baseline knows:

    0x00000000:  rd  %asr17, %g2
    0x00000004:  srl  %g2, 0x1c, %g2
    0x00000008:  tst  %g2
    0x0000000c:  bne  0x84

Everything after the preamble is instruction-identical to the baseline
head: UART control `= 3` at `0x80000108`, GPTIMER scaler `= 39` at
`0x80000304` (still hardcoded for 40 MHz against the machine's 20 MHz —
preserved, and the RTEMS LEON3 BSP reprograms the prescaler at boot), timer
counter/config stores, then the jump to the ELF entry.

**Why accepted:** on the single-CPU boot the `bne` is not taken (asr17
reports no secondary CPUs present), so guest-observable behavior is
unchanged — proven by the passing boot smoke and identical PnP table.
**Risk:** if the FSW ever inspects the PROM contents or counts instructions
before the UART write, the preamble is visible.

## 2. PnP table: no difference

All 12 PnP words match the baseline byte-for-byte (the qtest caught one
real deviation during the port — the GPTIMER entry's IRQ field carried
upstream's 6 instead of the baseline's 10 — fixed in
`986ae3e937` by using the baseline IRQ values).

## 3. Boot UART log: no difference

`boot-smoke.sh` against `build/qemu-system-sparc`: PASS (normalized boot
sequence identical through `init: SAFE mode`).

## Deliberately preserved non-identical behavior

Documented in `docs/stix-port/baseline/README.md` (known non-issues): the
inert-on-`-kernel` psret/psref/wim patch, APBUART reset `0xf` overwritten
by the stub, CTRL IRQ index-0 wiring, the accidental ROTB READY pass,
guest-reachable device `assert`s, the uint32 `ftell` truncation with the
16.5 GB flash, and the vestigial `STIX_CONTROL` token. These match the
baseline; they are not port deviations.
